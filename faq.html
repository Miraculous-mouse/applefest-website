            <h2>❓Frequently Asked Questions❓</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>💵 How much money should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the parking garage. If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can be found here.</dd>
                <dt>💳 Can I pay with a credit card?</dt>
                <dd>Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are interested in does not accept them.</dd>
                <dt>⌚️ When is the best time to attend?</dt>
                <dd>If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.</dd>
                <dt>🍻 Will there be alcohol?</dt>
                <dd>Some vendors do sell alcohol (such as hard cider), so be sure to bring your ID if you are over 21. Many of these vendors also offer tastings.</dd>
